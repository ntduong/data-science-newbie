MongoDB - simple & addtional tutorial

1. How to convert the ObjectId from a string
from bson.objectid import ObjectId
ObjectId(object_id_string)

Q. Why we need to do this
A. Let's param be the parameter to pass in: collection.find_xxx({"_id": param}),
then param's type must be ObjectId, not string

2. Range Queries
+ Use some advanced operators, like $lt, etc.

3. Sort
sort(key, order)
E.g: sort("date", 1)
	sort([("field1", pymongo.ASCENDING), ("field2", pymongo.DESCENDING)]) # multiple field sorting
order = 1: ASCENDING
order = -1: DESCENDING


4. Indexing
collection_name.create_index([(key1, order), (key2, order)])

where order might be ASCENDING, DESCENDING

Eg: Let's say we already have a collection, called posts

d = datetime.datetime.utcnow()
posts.create_index([("date", DESCENDING), ("author", ASCENDING)]) # (compound) indexing by date and author field keys
posts.find({"date":{"$lt": d}}).sort("author").explain()["cursor"]
											  .explain()["nscanned"]
											  
*Note: Use explain() to get some info about how the query is being performend internally.

5. What does find() or find_one() return?
+ Cursor instance, which allow us to iterate over all matching documents.
